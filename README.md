# Halton Skills

At my local school board, an annual contest is ran for many different areas and categories, however the website for it in my opinion seems a bit outdated so to continue learning React and CSS I decided to make my own version of the website.

## Getting Started

As usual run `npm install` to install all the dependencies and then run `npm start` to start the development server.

You can build the project using `npm run build` and serve it as you please.

This project is not affiliated with HDSB in any way shape or form.
