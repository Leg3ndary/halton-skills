# Halton Skills

This project is just meant for me to practice some of the skills I've learned through hackathons and personal learning.

This project is built using React and typescript, as well as Vite.

You can run the dev version of the project using `npm run start` or `npm start`.

You can build and optimize the project using `npm run build`.

Finally you can serve it using `npm run serve`.
